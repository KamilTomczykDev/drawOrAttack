# Draw or Attack - Javascript project
drawOrAttack is a card game inspired by Hearthstone made by Blizzard. At the start of the game user gets a set of 3 random cards and then the battle against the enemy begins. This is my first custom project and I remember It as a huge milestone in my web-dev journey. The idea behind the project was to learn vanilla JavaScript, CSS and HTML.
